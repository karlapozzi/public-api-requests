# Practice Using a Public API
My fifth Treehouse Techdegree project: A fictitious employee directory made using a public API. I am going for an exceeds expectations grade, so this project includes a search option, buttons to navigate through the list of employees when the modal is open, and some custom styling and css.

The custom style changes are: 
- Changed h1 font, size, and padding
- Disabled prev or next modal buttons on the first and last modal respectively 
- Changed background color and disabled cursor for those disabled buttons
- Also removed border and added padding around those buttons
- Added error message if something goes wrong with the API call
- Added no results message for search (with custom font)
- Added search padding so it aligns with new font in header
